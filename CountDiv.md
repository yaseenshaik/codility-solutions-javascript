Write a function:

function solution(A, B, K);

that, given three integers A, B and K, returns the number of integers within the range [A..B] that are divisible by K, i.e.:

{ i : A ≤ i ≤ B, i mod K = 0 }

For example, for A = 6, B = 11 and K = 2, your function should return 3, because there are three numbers divisible by 2 within the range [6..11], namely 6, 8 and 10.

Assume that:

* A and B are integers within the range [0..2,000,000,000];
* K is an integer within the range [1..2,000,000,000];
* A ≤ B.

Complexity:

* expected worst-case time complexity is O(1);
* expected worst-case space complexity is O(1).

```js
function solution(A, B, K) {
    return (Math.floor(B/K) - Math.floor((A-1)/K));
}
```
